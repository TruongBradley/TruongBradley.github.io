      <td>A type of automatic transmission that seamlessly varies gear ratios, providing smoother acceleration.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Differential</td>
      <td>A device that splits torque between the wheels, allowing them to rotate at different speeds, essential for smooth turns.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Downforce</td>
      <td>The aerodynamic force that pushes a vehicle towards the ground, improving traction and stability at high speeds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>EV (Electric Vehicle)</td>
      <td>A vehicle that operates entirely on electric power, using one or more electric motors for propulsion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Horsepower</td>
      <td>A unit of power measurement in the automotive context, indicating the engine's ability to perform work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Hybrid</td>
      <td>A vehicle with both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, allowing for improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics II)</td>
      <td>A standardized system for monitoring and reporting vehicle performance issues, helping in diagnostics and maintenance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Oversteer</td>
      <td>A handling condition where the rear tires lose traction during a turn, causing the rear of the vehicle to swing out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)</td>
      <td>A hybrid vehicle with a larger battery that can be charged by plugging into an external power source.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive)</td>
      <td>A drivetrain configuration where power is sent to the rear wheels, typically found in performance and sports cars.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Sedan</td>
      <td>A four-door passenger car with a separate trunk compartment for cargo.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle)</td>
      <td>A versatile vehicle designed for off-road capabilities with the comfort and amenities of a passenger car.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Torque</td>
      <td>The rotational force produced by an engine, important for a vehicle's acceleration and towing capabilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Traction Control System</td>
      <td>A system that regulates wheel spin during acceleration by adjusting engine power or applying brake force to specific wheels.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Turbocharger</td>
      <td>A device that increases engine power by forcing more air into the combustion chamber, improving efficiency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Understeer</td>
      <td>A handling condition where the front tires lose traction during a turn, causing the vehicle to drift wide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)</td>
      <td>A unique code assigned to each vehicle, containing information about its manufacturer, model, and specifications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Wattage</td>
      <td>The power rating of a car's audio system, measured in watts, indicating its sound output capability.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Wheelbase</td>
      <td>The distance between the front and rear axles of a vehicle, affecting stability and ride comfort.</td>
